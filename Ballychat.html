If you decide to cancel, please keep in mind that you might miss out on upcoming games, especially those featuring your preferred team.

                                <p>You can pause your current subscription for up to 6 months. During this time, you won't be billed, but you'll retain the option to resume your subscription when you're ready to watch your team again. This way, you won't miss out on any games in the future. <p/>

However, I'd like to highlight that our platform offers a wide range of other sports content, including NBA, NHL, and many more, which might still interest you.

                                <p>Additionally, if you decide to pause your current subscription for up to 6 months, you won't miss out on any of these games, and you can reactivate your subscription when your preferred MLB team is added.</p>

                                <p>Would you consider pausing your subscription to enjoy other available sports content and keep your options open for the future? Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.</p>

Additionally, you may want to check if there are any firmware or software updates available for your TV or cable/satellite box that could address this issue. If the problem persists, you may want to contact your service provider to see if they can provide any further assistance.

                            <p>Couch Rights is a Bally Sports+ subscription feature that allows you to watch premium content on your devices outside of your home billing zip code for up to 30 days. It will be activated automatically once you begin watching premium content from a location that is more than 50 miles away from the center of your home location or the zip code registered on the account. And if you lose access to premium content because your couch rights expire after 30 days, you must log in to the Bally Sports app with location services enabled within a 50-mile radius of the center of your account's registered home zip code to restore services.</p>

                            <p>Bally Sports has a feature called "Couch Rights" that allows you to continue watching on your application for 30 days even if you travel more than 50 miles from your home zip code. Your device will then be locked out, and you will need to go back to your home zip code.</p>

                            <p>I understand that you may be asking why there is a limitation on how many days you can use our service when you are outside of your zip code. Let me explain more. Our service, which we term "Couch Rights,", is designed to give premium content to consumers while they are more than 50 miles away from the center of their home location. This implies that you can still access our premium content even if you are traveling or temporarily residing somewhere else.</p>
